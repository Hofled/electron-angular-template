# ElectronAngularTemplate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Requirements & Installation

The project is using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as it's package manager.
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine (which comes packaged with `npm`) in order to run everything.
Before running the project, make sure to run `npm install` to have all node modules installed.

## Angular Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Development builds

Use the npm script `npm run dev-build:w` to automatically compile changes of either your Angular application or your Electron main process source files.
If you only want to compile your changes once and not automatically, you may run `npm run dev-build` once.
After saving changes in a file, the projects will be recompiled, and you can then press "Ctrl + r" while focusing the application's window to refresh it and load the new compiled app.

## Serve development application

In order to serve the development application, use the npm script `npm run e-start`, which will launch your compiled Electron application in development mode.

## Build executable

TODO - complete this section for how to build the application, and package a distributable executable Electron application.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
